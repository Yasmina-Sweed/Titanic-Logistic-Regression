# Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression ðŸš¢

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a **Logistic Regression model** that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. The project includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic classification problem in machine learning. The main goal is to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, fare, etc. This project demonstrates:

- How to clean and prepare data
- Perform EDA using visualizations
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle

- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger
- `Survived`: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`: Personal information
- `SibSp`, `Parch`: Family relationships
- `Ticket`, `Fare`: Ticket details
- `Cabin`, `Embarked`: Boarding details

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Encoding categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Feature selection
- Data scaling

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution of survival based on gender, class, age
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Correlation matrix to analyze feature relationships

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Training

A **Logistic Regression** model was used to train on the preprocessed data:
